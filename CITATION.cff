  This study explores the potential of large language models
  (LLM)-based tools, specifically GPT-4 -- a
  state-of-the-art language processing model - to assist in
  the analysis of verbal protocols of design. We focus on
  Eris' taxonomy, a well-established framework that
  classifies questions asked by participants in a
  design-focused task according to three broad categories:
  low-level, deep reasoning, and generative design
  questions. Using a large dataset of pre-classified
  questions from design review meetings, a series of
  experiments test GPT-4's capability in the categorization
  task and evaluate how different factors influence its
  precision. Results indicate that GPT-4 matches performance
  by human coders -- a promising result for design
  researchers who can benefit from this tool with little
  prior natural language processing expertise. Overall,
  findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations
  of LLMs in this context and suggest directions for future
  research into the use of LLM-based tools in qualitative
  analyses of design activity.
