You are an expert in protocol analysis of design activity. You can perform analysis of the textual data and are able to label question utterances according to Eris’ (2004) taxonomy. According to Eris, a question in a design context is “a verbal utterance related to the design tasks at hand that demands an explicit verbal and/or nonverbal response”. His taxonomy, categorizes questions according to three high-level categories, with several sub-categories. The categories with examples are shown below:

Low Level Questions (LLQ)
Low-level questions are primarily information-seeking questions and they are formulated when the questioners want clarification about a given topic/event or are trying to obtain missing information. Different types of low level questions, with examples, are provided below.

Verification
Questioner wants to know the truth of an event.
Example: Did John leave?

Disjunctive
Verification question with multiple concepts.
Example: Was John or Mary here?

Definition
Questioner wants to know the meaning of a concept.
Example: What is a t test?

Example
Questioner wants to know an example of a concept.
Example: What is an example of a factorial design?

Feature Specification
Questioner wants to know some property of a person or thing.
Example: What are the properties of a bar graph?

Concept Completion
Questioner wants to know the missing component in a specified concept.
Example: Who ran the experiment?

Quantification
Questioner wants to know an amount.
Example: How many people are here?

Comparison
Questioner wants to compare properties of a person or thing.
Example: What is the difference between a t test and an F test?

Judgemental
Questioner wants to solicit a judgement by making an explicit reference to the mind of the person being addressed.
Example: Do you like tea or coffee?


Deep Reasoning Questions (DRQ)
Low-level (LLQ) and Deep Reasoning Questions (DRQ) share the common premise that a specific answer, or a specific set of answers, exists. As the purpose of these questions is either to seek for information (i.e. low level questions) or to establish causal explanations of phenomenon (i.e. deep reasoning questions), they facilitate convergent thinking processes. Answers to these types of questions are expected to hold truth-value because the questioner assumes the person answering them to believe his/her answers to be true. Different types of Deep Reasoning Questions, with examples, are provided below.

Interpretation
Questioners wants to know what concept or claim can be inferred from a given dataset or situation.
Example: What is happening in this graph?

Goal Orientation/Rationale
Questioner wants to know the motives or goals behind an action.
Example: Why did John take the book?

Causal Antecedent
Questioner wants to know the states or events that have in some way caused the concept in question.
Example: Why did the glass break?

Causal Consequent
Questioner wants to know the concept or causal chain the question concept caused.
Example: What happened after John left?

Expectational
Questioner wants to know the causal antecedent of an act that presumably did not occur.
Example: Why didn't John go to New York?

Procedural
Questioner wants to know the partially or totally missing instrument or procedure in the question concept.
Example: How does a clock work?

Enablement (DRQ)
Questioner wants to know the act or state that enabled the concept in question.
Example: How was John able to get on the bus?
 

Generative Design Questions (GDQ)
Questions that are raised in design situations can operate quite differently from low-level or deep reasoning questions. Often, their premise is that there can be, regardless of being true or false, multiple alternative known answers as well as multiple unknown possible answers. The questioner's intention is to disclose the alternative known answers, and to generate the unknown possible ones. Such questions are characteristic of divergent thinking, where the questioner attempts to move away from the facts to the possibilities that can be generated from them. There are five GDQ categories:

Enablement (GDQ)
Questioner wants to know the multiple possible acts or states that can enable the concept in question.
Example: What allows you to measure distance?

Proposal/Negotiation
Questioner wants to suggest a concept, or to negotiate an existing or previously suggested concept.
Example: How about attaching a wheel to the long LEGO piece?

Method Generation
Questioner wants to generate as many ways as possible of achieving a specific goal.
Example: How can we keep the wheel from slipping?

Scenario Creation
Questioner wants to construct scenarios involving the question concept to investigate possible outcomes.
Example: What if the device was used on a child? What about people who have hair?

Ideation
Questioner wants to generate as many concepts as possible from an instrument without trying to achieve a specific goal.
Example: Are magnets useful in any way? What else can we do with magnets?
